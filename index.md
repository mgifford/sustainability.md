  # SUSTAINABILITY.md

  ## Commitment
  - Sustainability is part of our definition of done
  - We improve month over month, not once per year

  ## CI guardrails
  - Block on critical accessibility regressions
  - Block on page-weight and request-budget regressions

  ## AI policy
  - Prefer deterministic tools first
  - Keep prompts scoped, log usage, and avoid waste

  ## Ownership
  - Assign owners, baselines, targets, and review cadence
  - Publish trade-offs and exceptions with expiry dates

framework_cards:
  - title: Shared Commitment
    body: Make sustainability explicit in your repo so every contributor understands expectations before shipping code.
  - title: Measurable Operations
    body: Define budgets, owners, and review cadence so sustainability becomes trackable work, not an abstract aspiration.
  - title: Guardrails in CI
    body: Automate checks for accessibility, performance budgets, and risky additions to prevent regressions at merge time.

adopt_heading: How to Adopt
adopt_steps:
  - title: 1. Publish a starter commitment
    body: Add a short SUSTAINABILITY.md with goals, ownership, and non-negotiable CI gates.
  - title: 2. Add required CI checks
    body: Gate pull requests with accessibility checks, Lighthouse scans, and budget regression checks.
  - title: 3. Adopt the full template
    body: Add governance, exception handling, metrics baselines, and monthly review process.
  - title: 4. Ratchet over time
    body: Raise thresholds progressively as your project stabilizes and contributors build confidence.

Most repositories have README, SECURITY, and CONTRIBUTING files.
SUSTAINABILITY.md fills an important gap: it states how your project reduces
digital waste, handles trade-offs, and enforces sustainability in daily work.

## Why teams adopt it

- It creates a clear public commitment that users and contributors can see.
- It helps maintainers align product, engineering, accessibility, and DevOps.
- It gives AI coding agents explicit constraints before they generate changes.
- It turns vague goals into measurable implementation steps.

## What makes this effective

- **Visible policy:** one predictable file in the repo root.
- **Operational ownership:** named owners, targets, and review cadence.
- **CI enforcement:** checks that prevent regression, not just aspirational text.
- **Continuous improvement:** a ratchet model that gets stricter over time.

## Start in under 30 minutes

1. Copy the [template](./SUSTAINABILITY-template.md).
2. Add project scope, owner, and 3-5 baseline metrics.
3. Link your SUSTAINABILITY.md from README.
4. Enable CI gates for accessibility + performance budgets + Lighthouse.
5. Schedule a monthly review and raise one threshold.

**Status:** Draft (work in progress).

**AI disclosure:** This project has been developed with AI-assisted drafting
and implementation support, with human review and editing.

Adopt this now, keep it lightweight, and iterate. Progress over perfection.
