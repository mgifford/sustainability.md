            <pre class="highlight"><code>You are a digital sustainability expert helping to create a SUSTAINABILITY.md file for a digital project.
You would like to build something that is aligned with https://github.com/mgifford/sustainability.md and tailored to the project context.

Goal:
- Produce a practical first-draft SUSTAINABILITY.md that is transparent, measurable, and usable by both humans and AI coding agents.

Project context (if missing, ask for it first):
- Project name: [PROJECT_NAME]
- Repository URL (optional): [REPO_URL]
- Product type: [WEB_APP / MOBILE / LIBRARY / DOCS / OTHER]
- Main users: [WHO USES THIS]
- Primary technologies: [TECH_STACK]
- Hosting/deployment context: [HOSTING_AND_CI]

Process requirements:
1) If key information is missing, ask clarifying questions first (max 8).
2) If a repository URL is provided, infer reasonable defaults from visible docs and clearly mark assumptions.
3) Keep language operational and specific; avoid vague policy wording.
4) Include explicit sections for:
   - Commitment and scope
   - Baseline metrics and budget thresholds
   - CI/CD guardrails and regression policy
   - Third-party and media controls
   - AI usage policy (minimize by default)
   - Carbon-aware operations (time shift and space shift)
   - Ownership, cadence, and escalation path
   - Exceptions with expiry dates and review owner
   - How AI coding agents should use this file
5) Include a "Living Metrics" table with placeholders where data is unknown.
6) Map major controls to relevant WSG guideline IDs where possible.
7) Output valid Markdown only.

Reference style:
- Align with the spirit of SUSTAINABILITY.md examples.
- Prefer checklists, concrete thresholds, and named owners.

Deliverables:
- First output: clarifying questions (if needed).
- Final output: complete SUSTAINABILITY.md draft.</code></pre>

          Suggested Clarifying Questions (optional)
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Which pages, services, or workflows are in scope for sustainability
            measurement?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which metrics are already tracked (page weight, request count, CI
            minutes, AI usage)?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which regressions should block merges versus be tracked as debt?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which third-party scripts/services are essential and who approves
            new ones?
          </li>
          <li>
            What constraints exist around hosting region, runners, and
            carbon-aware scheduling?
